HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript.

### About:
We were required to develop an interactive mobile application with a genuine purpose. It had to have a UI that works effectively on mobile devices, load and utilise external data such as JSON or XML, and demonstrate the application of suitable advanced tools.

The purpose of the application developed is to present he NFL in a format for information retrieval. It higilights all aspects of the league from the 2021-22 NFL season. The application utilises an API from a GitHub repo that provides an exhaustive list of NLF API endpoints from ESPN. Multiple JSON data includin teams, athletes, venue, athlete notes, stats and team stats were used. Seveal sections of the application are dynamic and the information and data shown, including images, are dynamically generated.

### How to use: 
Navigate the application.

*Please note that the application may not function as desired due to issues with the API being used.
